  "description": "CPY (short for \"ComPare Y\") is a machine language instruction that compares the contents of the Y index register against a specified operand by subtracting the latter from the former. This operation sets the negative and carry flags based on the result, but unlike SBC, the result of the subtraction is discarded, leaving the register unaffected.",
