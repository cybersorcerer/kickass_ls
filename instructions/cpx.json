  "mnemonic": "CPX",
  "description": "CPX (short for \"ComPare X\") is the mnemonic for a machine language instruction which compares the contents of the X index register against that of the specified operand by subtracting the latter from the former, and setting the negative and carry flags according to the result. Unlike SBC, the result of the subtraction is discarded rather than stored back into the register, which is thus unaffected by the CPX operation.",
