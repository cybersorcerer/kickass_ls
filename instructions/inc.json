  "mnemonic": "INC",
  "description": "INC (INCrease) is the mnemonic for a machine language instruction which increases the numerical value of the contents of the address specified by one, and \"wraps over\" when the numerical limits of a byte are exceeded. If the byte in question is taken as an unsigned integer, INC \"counts\" from 0 thru 255/$0 thru $FF. If a byte already containing the value 255/$FF is INCremented, it \"wraps over\" to the value 0. If the byte is taken as a signed integer, INC will \"count\" from −128 thru +127, or −$80 thru +$7F. If a byte already holding the value 127/$7F is INCremented, it \"wraps over\" to the value −128/−$80.",
