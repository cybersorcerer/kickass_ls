  "description": "BVS (short for \"Branch if oVerflow Set\") is the mnemonic for a machine language instruction which branches, or \"jumps\", to the address specified if, and only if the overflow flag is set. If the overflow flag is clear when the CPU encounters a BVC instruction, the CPU will continue at the instruction following the BVC rather than taking the jump.",
