  "description": "CMP (CoMPare accumulator) is a machine language instruction which compares the byte held in the accumulator with the byte held in the memory address specified. The comparison is performed by internally subtracting the memory value from the accumulator value, and setting the N, Z, and C flags according to the result. The accumulator and memory contents are not altered.",
