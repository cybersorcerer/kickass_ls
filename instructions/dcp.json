  "description": "DCP (short for \"Decrease then ComPare\") is a mnemonic for an illegal opcode machine language instruction. This illegal opcode is a combination of two operations with the same addressing mode: DEC, followed by CMP. DCP can be used to effectively implement the indexed-indirect and indirect-indexed addressing modes that DEC lacks.",
