  "mnemonic": "DEY",
  "description": "DEY (DEcrease Y) is a machine language instruction which decrements the numerical value of Y index register, by one, and \"wraps over\" if the value goes below the numerical limits of a byte. If the Y index register is taken as an unsigned integer, DEY \"counts down\" from 255 thru 0/$FF thru $0. If the index register already contains the minimum value of 0/$0 as it is decremented, it \"wraps over\" to the value 255/$FF. If the Y index register is taken as a signed integer, DEY will \"count down\" from +127 thru −128, or +$7F thru −$80. If the register already contains the value −128/−$80 when it is decremented, it \"wraps over\" to the value +127/$7F.",
