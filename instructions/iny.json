  "mnemonic": "INY",
  "description": "INY (INcrease Y) is a machine language instruction which increases the numerical value held in the Y index register by one, and \"wraps over\" when the numerical limits of a byte are exceeded. If the Y index register is taken as an unsigned integer, INY \"counts\" from 0 thru 255/$0 thru $FF. If the register already holds value 255/$FF as it is incremented, it \"wraps over\" to the value 0. If the Y index register is taken as a signed integer, INY will \"count\" from −128 thru +127, or −$80 thru +$7F. If the register contains 127/$7F when incremented, it \"wraps over\" to the value −128/−$80.",
