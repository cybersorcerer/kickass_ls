# Implementation Recommendations

## Strategic Implementation Recommendations

### Critical Lessons Learned Today:
1. **Never break existing functionality** - every change must be backwards compatible
2. **Minimal, targeted changes** - avoid sweeping modifications
3. **Test immediately** - validate each small change before proceeding
4. **Systematic analysis** - understand the problem completely before coding

### Implementation Priority & Risk Assessment:

**PHASE 1: Low-Risk Extensions (Do First)**
- **kickass-directive-plan.md**: Add missing illegal opcodes and built-in functions
  - Risk: LOW - These are pure additions, won't break existing code
  - Approach: Add new token types and parser cases incrementally
  - Test: Each new directive individually

**PHASE 2: Medium-Risk Enhancements (Do Carefully)**
- **semantic-improvements-plan.md**: Address calculation and branch validation
  - Risk: MEDIUM - Could affect existing symbol resolution
  - Approach: Add new analysis passes without changing existing ones
  - Critical: Maintain current symbol table structure

**PHASE 3: High-Risk Changes (Do Last, If Ever)**
- **formatting-plan.md**: Complete autoformat system
  - Risk: HIGH - Complex token metadata changes
  - Concern: Could break lexer/parser integration
  - Recommendation: Prototype separately first

**PHASE 4: Architecture Changes (Extreme Caution)**
- **refactor-plan.md**: Layer separation redesign
  - Risk: EXTREME - Would require rewriting everything
  - Recommendation: Only consider after all features proven stable
  - Alternative: Gradual refactoring of individual components

### Specific Next Steps:

1. **Start with illegal opcodes** - pure lexer additions (SLO, RLA, etc.)
2. **Add built-in functions** - extend parser without changing existing evaluation
3. **Implement anonymous labels** - new token types for !, !+, !-
4. **Add semantic passes** - layer on top of existing symbol resolution
5. **Consider formatting** - only after everything else is rock solid

The key insight from today: **incremental additions > wholesale changes**. Each plan document represents months of work - we must proceed with surgical precision, not broad strokes.
